# CocoaPods
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However, if you have
# an application project that contains a Pods directory, you can add it.
# Pods/
#
# Or, if you are using CocoaPods with a framework project, you can add:
# Pods/
# Podfile.lock

# macOS
.DS_Store
